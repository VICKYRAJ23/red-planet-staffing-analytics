  Clipboard Frontend Small Ticket Assessment
  <br>
  <br>
</h1>

In this exercise, you’ll be producing a pull request to address a ticket raised by a Product Manager on our team. This is a common process at Clipboard Health: the Product Manager for your team will write a ticket or brief describing a customer problem and their proposed solution, and you’ll produce a pull request addressing the problem.

For this exercise, you’ll be adding a feature in the “Red Planet” repository. For the business context, see **[README-Red-Planet](https://github.com/codescreen/CodeScreen_ng2rkzbu/blob/main/README-Red-Planet.md)**.

What you deliver should be a Pull Request. Your Pull Request should:  
- Solve the problem outlined by the PM.  
- Have high quality, defensive, extensible code that you would feel comfortable running in production. Keep technical excellence and customer experience in mind. We know you don’t have a Product Designer to partner with here, but leverage the frameworks and their established patterns and conventions as needed.  
- Include a good PR description as you would if you were submitting this for review from other engineers on your actual team. The PR description must include a link to a video recording that demos your solution for the reviewers. In the video, talk us through the changes you made, and explain your design decisions as you go (why did you design and implement things the way you did, vs. alternative approaches you could’ve taken?). If there are particularly interesting aspects of your technical solution, highlight those and show off your code too.  

The Product Brief for this task should have been emailed to you, please refer to that.
