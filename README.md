# Welcome to Your Clipboard Assessment

You’ve been invited to this Repo to complete a technical assessment. Please follow the instructions carefully, as the repository contains multiple assessments and only one applies to you.

## Step 1: Identify the Assessment Assigned to You

The assessment you should complete is explicitly mentioned in the email you received. Use that email as your single source of truth.

## Step 2: Read the Correct README

This repository contains READMEs for three different assessments, please read only the one that matches your assessment title:
### First Round
- **[Red Planet Top Workplaces](README-Red-Planet.md)**
  - If you have just applied, this is the assessment you are expected to complete.
  - The other tasks in this repository are second-round assessments and do not apply to you. Please ignore those folders entirely.
### Second Round
- **[Small Ticket (Backend)](README-Backend-Small-Task.md) (Second Round only)**
  - Complete this only if your email explicitly instructs you to do so.

- **[Small Ticket (Frontend)](README-Frontend-Small-Task.md) (Second Round only)**
  - Complete this only if your email explicitly instructs you to do so.

Please note, all assessments live in the same repository, but you are expected to complete only one. If anything is unclear, please reach out before starting.
