  Clipboard Backend Small Ticket Assessment
  <br>
  <br>
</h1>

## Overview

In this exercise, you’ll be producing a **Pull Request** to address a ticket raised by a Product Manager on our team.

This is a common process at Clipboard Health: the Product Manager for your team will write a ticket or brief describing a customer problem and their proposed solution, and you’ll produce a Pull Request addressing the problem.

For this exercise, you’ll be adding a feature in the **Red Planet** repository.

For business context, see:  
**[README-Red-Planet.md](https://github.com/codescreen/CodeScreen_ng2rkzbu/blob/main/README-Red-Planet.md)**
